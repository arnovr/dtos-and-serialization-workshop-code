# Deserializing user input

Situation: we need to *deserialize* a string sent to us as the body of an HTTP request into an *object graph* of domain objects (and eventually persist it).

## Solution 1: Standard deserialization tool

Use an automated, configurable standard deserialization tool like [JMSSerializer](http://jmsyst.com/libs/serializer).

New problems when we implement solution 1:

- Because this library uses reflection, it ignores any object boundary that we put into place to protect our object invariants.
- Validation of the created objects only happens afterwards. We end up with objects in an invalid state.
- When the objects are managed by an ORM, they are registered in its *identity map*, which means its changes might be accidentally persisted.

%% TODO add example code

## Solution 2: Custom deserializer

Provide a custom deserializer, which tries to reconstruct the object and catches/collects exceptions.

New problems when we implement solution 2:

- We can't provide a full list of problems to the user, since exceptions will break the flow of execution.

<!-- TODO add example code -->

## Solution 3: Deserialize to a DTO first

Don't deserialize right into domain objects. Instead introduce an intermediate object (called DTO) and copy the data into it. Provide the user with validation results or (when the DTO is valid) let the application layer handle the DTO.

Implementation details:

- Copy any data directly into the DTO object (you may use JMSSerializer).
- Add no constructor/setter constraints.
- Validate the object afterwards, generate a list of errors (you may use the Symfony Validator, or the simpler but less feature-complete [Valitron](https://github.com/vlucas/valitron) for this workshop).
- After validating, hand over the DTO to the application layer to let the domain object process the requested changes (for now you could simply update the domain object).
